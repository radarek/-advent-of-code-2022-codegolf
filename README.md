# Advent of Code 2022 ⛳

Here are my golfed solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

All programs read data from the standard input stream and outputs answers to the standard output stream. This makes very easy to run programs with different set of input tests, using `<` in the shell:

```shell
ruby solver.rb < test0.in
```
